Some basic Maths

```{r}
1 + 100

10 * 10

(10 * 10) + 2
```

Now lets' try something more complicated

```{r}
sin(1)
log(1)


```

Create some variables....

```{r}
x <- sin(1)
x * 10


```

```{r}
x == 5

```

Vectors....


```{r}
myVector <- 1:10
myVector
```

```{r}
myVector *2
```

Installing Packages

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```


```{r}

library(ggplot2)
```

## Challenge 2

```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```

## Challenge 3

```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
mass > age
```

The mass was greater than age!
